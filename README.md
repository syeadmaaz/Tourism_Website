## Tourism Website


### Project Overview
------------------------------------

This is a front-end of Sikkim Tourism Website. This is a user-friendly project for the beginners in web development. Here we have provided images of different places of sikkim on the main page in order to attract the travellers. Also gave some information regarding Tour Packages and Testimonials regarding travelling and places. Along with it we have also given the Contact option as well as Subscribing the website option so that traveller does recieves imporatnt notifications on E-mail. 

### Solution Description
------------------------------------

* We initiated the front-end work with some of the well known languages such as HTML, Cascading style-sheets.
* Through HTML, the appearance of images, links, headings, text, page layout and just about every element of a web page is formatted. In easy words we can explain, we structured the content through HTML.
* With the help of CSS, we designed our web pages, controlled the look and feel of the content written in HTML. It means that if we have a website element, let’s say a “title”, and we want to make the text size “20px”, the color “black”, and the padding around it “10px”, we would use CSS to control the look of our element.
